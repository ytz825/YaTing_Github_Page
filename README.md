### Projects I worked on :chart_with_upwards_trend:
1. Pitney Bowes 2021 Data Challenge :mailbox_closed:: https://github.com/ytz825/Pitney-Bowes-Data-Challenge
    - Performed data cleaning, data visualization, feature extraction to ensure data quality as well as assessing the most important features for model implementation using Python packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn
    - Implemented a Random Forest Classifier model and tuned the model with RandomizedSearchCV to forecast whether postage meters will fail within the next 7 days using Python
    - Presented findings along with possible solutions Pitney Bowes can implement to reduce meter failures, and timely actions to perform when the meters are predicted to fail within the next 7 days
    - Nominated as one of the top 5 teams in the data challenge

2. Uber Analysis :taxi:
    - Proposed Uberâ€™s optimal marketing strategy through the application of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and SVM using R on the 2014 - 2015 Uber pickups datasets in NYC with validation accuracy of 96%, 90%, 80% respectively
